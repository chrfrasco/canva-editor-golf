# submission for 19

You could try to get the bundle size down, but what about shipping no Javascript at all? :big-think:

```shell
$ wc -c static/bundle.js
wc: dist/bundle.js: open: No such file or directory
```

Wow that's small!

**_Zero dependencies_** (bar the node http & url libraries) and zero javascript shipped to the user.
